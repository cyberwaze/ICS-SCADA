<h3>Welcome to this ICS/SCADA Learning area!</h3>
<p><b>Imagine...</b></p>
...a nation under attack – not from military actions in the air, sea or land – but from bad actors in <i>cyberspace.</i>
<p><b>Imagine...</b></p>
...you have none of the technology-enabled conveniences you use every day, like smart phones, online banking, 
mass transit or utilities.
<p><b>This is a <i>real</i> possibility...</b></p>
...because critical infrastructure and industrial control systems (ICS) that deliver these essential services 
throughout the United States and abroad depend on <b>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</b> technology to maintain 
safe and continuous operations. 
<br><br>These aging, legacy ICS/SCADA systems originated in the 1950's! And now they are being connected to corporate networks, 
the internet, the cloud and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). These systems are literally “sitting ducks” for
cyber-attacks – an idea that did not even exist when they were built. 
<h3>Explore this site!</h3>
<p>The technologies and risks related to ICS/SCADA affect hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide. Industry requires 
subject-matter professionals with breadth in core cybersecurity skills, but also specialized niche ICS/SCADA expertise, 
to sufficiently secure these extensively connected operational systems and networks.
