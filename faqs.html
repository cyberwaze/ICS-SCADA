<h3>If you don't find your answer below, <a href="mailto:mahoppa@nsu.edu?subject=ICS/SCADA FAQs">click here</a> to ask an expert.</h3>
<p class="accordion"><b>Q. Is the ICS/SCADA risk really that great?</b></p>
<div class="panel">Yes! Originating in the 1950’s, ICS/SCADA hardware, software, communications and standard 
operating procedures have not been consistently modernized to meet the rigors of the current technological 
landscape, especially in terms of cybersecurity. These aging, legacy ICS/SCADA components are now being connected 
to the internet, corporate networks, the cloud and even Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. This makes 
them “sitting ducks” to a wide variety of cyber-attacks.
<br><br>Cyber incidents can have life-threatening consequences for ICS/SCADA due to the critical nature of the services 
they support. In fact, these threats are so menacing the federal government enacted a series of Executive Orders to 
bring the problem to the forefront of the national  cybersecurity agenda.
</div>

<p class="accordion"><b>Q. What are the key ICS/SCADA vulnerabilities?</b></p>
<div class="panel">The following vulnerabilities are the most prevalent among these systems:
<br>* Connectivity to the public internet
<br>* Unpatched legacy software (e.g., Windows XP and 2000)
<br>* Weak authentication
<br>* Lack of antivirus software
<br>* Rogue (unauthorized, unrecognized) devices
<br>* Presence of undetected malwares and APTs
<br>* Remote management protocols
<br>* Wireless access points
<br>* High proportion of vulnerable devices 
<br>* Prevalance of unused components and functions
</div>

<p class="accordion"><b>Q. Since the problem has been recognized, aren't ICS/SCADA vulnerabilities and risks decreasing?</b></p>
<div class="panel">The trajectory is not what you would expect. In 2017, over 350 vulnerabilities that could allow 
cyber-attacks against ICS/SCADA systems were reported. In 2018, that figure more than doubled to 770. The average time to 
repair each flaw is around 5 months. The latency between time of flaw discover to time of repair offers frighteningly long windows 
of opportunity for sabotage and critical failures. It’s not a question of <i>if</i> one of these catastrophic attacks will succeed, 
but rather <i>when</i>, and what can we do quickly <i>now</i> to prevent them.

<p class="accordion"><b>Q. What are the key ICS/SCADA journals?</b></p>
<div class="panel">Click on the links for more details. <i>NOTE: External sites open in new tabs</i>
<br><br>* <a href="http://infonomics-society.org/ijicss/" target="_blank">International Journal of Industrial Control Systems Security</a>
<br><br>Select issues/articles may be found in:
<br>* <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10207" target="_blank">International Journal of Information Security</a>
<br>* <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tsec20/current" target="_blank">Journal of Cyber Security Technology</a>
<br>* <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-information-security-and-applications" target="_blank">Journal of Information Security and Applications</a>
</div>

<p class="accordion"><b>Q. What are employment prospects like in the ICS/SCADA industry?</b></p>
<div class="panel">A quick search of online job sites reveals literally thousands of ICS/SCADA jobs throughout the U.S., 
with salaries ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 depending on the role, responsiblities and applicant qualifications. 
<br><br>Job titles include:
<br>* Project Manager
<br>* Developer
<br>* Systems Integrator
<br>* Programmer (HMI, PLC, RTU)
<br>* Systems Engineer / Analyst
<br>* Technologist/Technician/Support Staff (troubleshooting, installing, networking)
<br><br>Applicants can expect to be asked a series of questions depending on the employer and position. These esponses 
are used as part of the screening process to help determine eligibility and qualifications for the position. Applicants 
should always include all relevant education and experiences in their resumes. A demonstration of recent or ongoing education 
and industry-recognized certifications such as Certified SCADA Security Architect (CSSA) is always a plus.
Due to the sensitive nature of the work, a background investigation may be required of job applicants including, 
but not limited to, suitability, security clearances, and other employer-specific requirements.
