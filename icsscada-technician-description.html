<b>SCADA Technicians</b> are in demand for a wide range of types and sizes of installations. Depending on the nature, 
size and criticality of the system(s), their duties will vary. The Technician ensures the components of the control system 
are functioning properly, manages their settings and deploys the correct security protocols across the networks. This employee
